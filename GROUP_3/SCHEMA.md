Group 3's Schema
---
A global variable would be set for current project number and current group number.

We would rely on 4 seperate dictionaries. 

<h1>Dictionary 1</h1>
Given an email will return a name for the person with that email
<h2>Dictionary 2</h2>
Given an email would return a current group number 
<h3>Dictionary 3(Multidimensional)</h3>
Given a name a group # and a project # would return the ranks recieved for that specific projects
<h4>Dictionary 4(Multidimensional)</h4>
Given a name and a project number would return people who already ranked a specific person.
