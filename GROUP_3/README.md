What we each did this weekend of 9/22-9/23:

Peter Jasko:Played with flask and jinja: routing,wrote a is it christmas page where you enter the date after the / and if it is 
it is 1225 a heading state IT IS CHRISTMAS appears. Anything else after the / results in a heading saying that
is is not christmas.I spent an hour skimming the flask doccumentation on a car ride to boston.

John Haggerty
I set up/installed virtualenv and flask. I took a look at the flask documentation as well as the jinja page. I spent about a half an hour looking through the documentation.
