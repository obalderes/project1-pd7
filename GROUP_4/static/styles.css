/* Pretend this is CSS! Whatever we write in CSS or JavaScript should go here so Flask can handle it properly- it's easier than if you were to put the CSS directly in the HTML file and it's a lot more organized and stuff. Typically you have one CSS file that sets the styles and stuff for a bunch of HTML files. */
