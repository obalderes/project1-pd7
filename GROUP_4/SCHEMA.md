We will have 2 shelves for accessing data.  One shelve will be called questions and will be a dictionary with keys being names and each name will refer to a dictionary of questions. Each question will refer to a list of ratings.  Our second shelve will be called groups and will be a dictionary with keys being names and each name will refer to a list of the people in their group.  The key of names will be first,last,email.
