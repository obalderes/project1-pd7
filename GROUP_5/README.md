============
<p>Mengdi Lin: I played around with Flask and briefly read through its documentation for around 30 minutes. I have a rough idea of how I can use it to generate urls. I read over a part of the sample code that pertains to user login. The codes included request.form() method which I am confused about. Also, I still don't understand what is a request object. For our first project, I am still shaky about storing data on a website and getting user's feedback.</p>
