============

<p>Mengdi Lin: I played around with Flask and briefly read through its documentation for around 30 minutes. 
I have a rough idea of how I can use it to generate urls. I read over a part of the sample code 
that pertains to user login. The codes included request.form() method which I am confused about. 
Also, I still don't understand what is a request object. For our first project, I am still shaky about 
storing data on a website and getting user's feedback.</p>

<p>Brian Lam: Over the weekend, I did some research on how to install Python virtual environments
on Windows. I sent out an email to the group to help the other people who are using Windows 
(I use Windows because my computer's ethernet doesn't work when I run Ubuntu for some reason). After
finding out how to activate the virtual environment, I installed Flask and Jinja. </p>
