Hayden:  
I explored CSS as a whole, and HTML Kickstart. I think HTML Kickstart's "Vertical Left Menu"  
would be ideal for this type of project. Shreya and I also spent some time brainstorming  
the overall design of the webpage. We discussed all the different pages and how we hope to  
layout each page.  
Total Time Spent: ~90 Minutes

Shreya:
Once I was able to download Flask, I read over the documentation and quickstart and played around with it. I also created a test template to try out that documentation as well. I explored how html and CSS work, and looked into HTML Kickstart and Twitter Bootstrap. Hayden and I also discussed the overall layout of the page and possible design blueprints for each individual page. 
Time Spent: Most of Sunday afternoon.
