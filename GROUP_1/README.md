Downloaded and installed Flask and virtual environment. Took longer than expected, but played around with flask (mostly input stuff) for about 30-45 minutes. 

<b>Dexter Tong-Programming Design</b>
Downloaded Virtualenv and Flask, which was fairly straightforward. I tried making basic classes in flask for 15ish minutes and got bored. I guess I'll have to figure out how flask works better, as well as coding in python.
