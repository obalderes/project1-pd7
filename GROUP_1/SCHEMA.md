Uno's (provisional name)  Schema
---
Our project will be awesome. With pretty pictures. Oh, and 2 dictionaries.

<h1> Personal Info Dictionary </h1>
This will probably take email addresses as keys and return a list containing the person's first and last names as well as group number and project number corresponding to that group.

<h2> Peer Review Dictionary</h2>
This will take the email address of the person being reviewed and store the email of the reviewer, the answers to the questions (likely a few on a scale of 1-10 type things), and a string for comments. All of this will be stored as another list of strings.

<h3>Other Stuff</h3>
This schema is subject to and probably will change as we ~~copy~~ think of better ideas.
