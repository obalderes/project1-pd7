GROUP 2

TO USERS:

launch the app with feedbackerator.py, we had some random issues where first ru\
n doesn't work, but please try again if that happens , we have a working build.

type in your email address, some errors occur with case sensitivity if your ema\
il doesn't work make sure you've entered it exactly as it appears on the studen\
ts.txt file

YOU HAVE TO RATE ALL THE USERS AT ONCE. Errors can be caused by not filling out\
 every bubble, we did not get a try-catch thing set up.

ratings as of now do not replace themselves as they entered. We are working on \
a method to do this.

Installed virtual environment! 9/23 6:35 p.m. Took a min.
Installed flask! 9/23 6:48 p.m. Took 5 mins.
Wow, I took a long break! I tried to read through the flask quickstart, but struggled for an hour or two with implementing some of the more complex stuff like url_get and requests...maybe looking at it with fresh eyes tomorrow will help. I did play around with the templates and get a url with a variable to work. I will be working on the design side and will try to google search some of the mentioned tools. 11:26 p.m.
