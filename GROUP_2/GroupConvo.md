Hey guys, it's David.

I didn't want to change the SCHEMA file without consulting you all first, so
I'll just document some stuff here so I don't forget it.

To start thing simple, I made a rate_page.html template file and a rate_page() method in the feedbackerator.py (basically, the app.py where the main python
stuff will be). There will need to be a txt file with all the questions and
code that parses through it, but for the time being, I hard-coded one
question.

So far, I have a page under the branch /rate that has a place to type in some
info about who's being rated (I called this username) and a sample question 
and set of radio buttons. Nothing happens when you click rate, yet.

to this file, so there's a way to keep all our thoughts together)
